# EmployeeManagerCLI
Objective: Make simple and easy data handler ,A command line project, CLI custom command, uses sql 
<br>
The project contains several commands and rules and must be followed for proper utilization of tool.
<br>
<br>
You need to have MySQL in your device. No need to set up manually;just launch the setup.exe and you are good to go.
<br>
The main launcher is execute.exe you can make a sortcut of it or can run from loacation. It is inside EmployeeManager_jar
<br>
<br>
Can also be used as an alternate SQL JDBC connector libery for simple to a little complex use makesure to use limit=3 in convertToquery("string as per rules",3)<br>
If possible suggest improvements<br> rest documentation is not needed . read the General Instructions file for knowing about commands and syntax
<br>
Thank you;
