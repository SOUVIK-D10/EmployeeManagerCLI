# EmployeeManagerCLI
Objective: Make simple and easy data handler ,A command line project, CLI custom command, uses sql 
<br>
The project contains several commands and rules and must be followed for proper utilization of tool.
<br>
I have used local database so you nee to setup sql database and modify connection by yourself
<br>
